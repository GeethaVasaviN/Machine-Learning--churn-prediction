# Customer Churn Prediction App

Predict customer churn using machine learning and interact with an easy-to-use **Streamlit web app**.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) based on historical customer data.  
It uses machine learning models and provides a real-time interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing and cleaning with Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Interactive Streamlit app for real-time churn prediction  
- User-friendly interface for inputting customer details  
- Clear visualization of prediction results
